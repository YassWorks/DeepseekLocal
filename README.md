My first Github project ever!

Based on a tutorial by Fireship on Youtube.
I made this VS Code extension to be able to use Deepseek locally.

Requirements:
- Ollama
- Download the model deepseek-r1:8b

TODO:
- better UI
- support for more models

UPDATE LOG:
- added better UI (new answers don't erase old ones now :D)
